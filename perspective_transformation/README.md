Perspective Transformation using OpenCV



This program applies a perspective transformation to an input image.

It uses four defined corner points to warp the image, creating a perspective effect.

The transformation is controlled by modifying the destination points.

The script also calculates the rank of the transformation matrix to verify its validity.
